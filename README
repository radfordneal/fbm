FLEXIBLE BAYESIAN MODELLING SOFTWARE (VERSION UNDER DEVELOPMENT)

** Use the commit tagged fbm-2022-04-21 for the latest stable version **

This directory and its subdirectories contain software for flexible
Bayesian learning of regression, classification, density, and other
models, based on multilayer perceptron neural networks, Gaussian
processes, finite and countably infinite mixtures, and Dirichlet
diffusion trees, as well as facilities for inferring sources of
atmospheric contamination and for molecular simulation.  These are
implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.  Facilities for
Markov chain sampling from distributions specified by simple formulas
for the density or for the prior and likelihood are also included.

For more information, see the files in the 'doc' directory.  The file
'index.html' in 'doc' has links to all the documentation, which is
easily perused with a web browser.  Note: You must access 'index.html'
in the 'doc' directory, not copy it somewhere else, since the links
are relative.  (Or, you can copy the entire directory elsewhere.)

This software can be found on Radford Neal's web page and in the
repository at https://gitlab.com/radfordneal/fbm
