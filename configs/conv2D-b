# Configuration file for biases for a 2D convolutional layer.  
#
# Convolution with filter patches is done only for patch positions that 
# completely fit with in the 2D image, with no zero padding, or wrapping.
#
# The filter biases are shared for all filter positions over the image, 
# but are different for different output filters (channels).
#
# The following variables should be set before this file is used:
#
#    X    Dimension of the source image in the X (faster varying) direction
#    Y    Dimension of the source image in the Y (slower varying) direction
#    D    Dimension of filter patches (always square)
#    F    Number of convolutional filters to produce (ie, output channels)
#         Default is 1
#    S    Stride for moving a patch to next position, the same for the X 
#         and Y directions.  Default is 1.
#
# The X dimension of the output is (X-D+S)/S, which should usually be
# an integer (if not, it is truncated).  Similarly, the Y dimension of
# the output is (Y-D+S)/S.
#
# The output units are formatted with the channel/filter varying fastest, 
# then the X dimension, and finally the Y dimension (slowest).
#
# The destination unit indexes, and bias indexes start after their
# current values (which by default will start at zero).

  x(                    # Loop over outputs in x direction
    F(                    # Loop over filter outputs
