# Configuration file for weights for a 2D pooling layer.  
#
# A pooling layer is like a convolutional layer with the same number of
# input and output channels, except that the weights are the same for all 
# positions within a patch, though different for each channel, and the
# output for each channel is found from the input for that channel only.
#
# The following variables should be set before this file is used:
#
#    X    Dimension of the source image in the X (faster varying) direction
#    Y    Dimension of the source image in the Y (slower varying) direction
#    D    Dimension of filter patches (always square)
#    C    Number of channels (eg, RGB, or previous filters) for both the
#         input and the output.  Default is 1.
#    S    Stride for moving a patch to next position, the same for the X 
#         and Y directions.  Default is 1.
#
# The X dimension of the output is (X-D+S)/S, which should usually be
# an integer (if not, it is truncated).  Similarly, the Y dimension of
# the output is (Y-D+S)/S.
#
# The input and output are formatted with the channel/filter varying fastest, 
# then the X dimension, and finally the Y dimension (slowest).  There is
# one weight for each channel.
#
# The source unit indexes, destination unit indexes, and weight
# indexes start after their current values (which by default will
# start at zero).  Afterwards, they will point to the beginning of the
# destination units used, and after the source units and weights used,
# which is appropriate for applying another pooling operation using later
# source units and weights.

      D(                    # Loop over x direction in filter patch
        C{ + + + }
        [ +C = = ]            # Move to next patch pixel in x direction
      )
      C[ +X-D = = ]         # Move to next patch pixel in y direction
    )
    C[ D[ -X = = ] ]      # Move patch to next position in x direction
    C[ +S = = ]
    [ = +C = ]            # Move to next group of filter outputs
  )
  C[ S[ +X = = ] ]      # Move patch to next position in y direction
  C[ x[ -S = = ] ]
)

x[ y[ = -C = ] ]      # Move back to start of destination units
[ = = +C ]            # Move past weights
y[ S[ X[ -C = = ] ] ] # Move to beginning of source units
Y[ X[ +C = = ] ]      # ... and then past all the source units
