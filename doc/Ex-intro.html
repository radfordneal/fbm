INTRODUCTION TO THE EXAMPLES

The following sections how the software can be used on several toy
problems.  These examples are meant to illustrate the features of the
software.  You should note that the models and Markov chain methods
used are not necessarily appropriate for other problems.  To gain a
full understanding of the various possibilities, and their advantages
and disadvantages, you will need to read both the pertinent references
(see <A HREF="Facilities.html">Facilities.doc</A>), and the detailed documentation on the various
commands.

The output shown for these examples was obtained by running the
software one machine, with "&gt;" at the start of a line indicating a
command line that was input.  It is possible (even likely) that your
results will differ, even if you have installed the software
correctly, since small differences in floating point arithmetic (eg,
due to whether or not fused multiply-add instructions are used, or to
different implementations of math functions) can be magnified into
large differences in the course of the simulation.  However, unless
one of the simulations became stuck in an isolated local mode, the
final predictions you obtain (eg, from 'net-pred' or 'gp-pred'), and
the final distributions of model parameters, should be close to those
reported below.

Some of the examples show the output of "xxx-plt" commands being piped
into a program called "plot", or "plot-points".  Any plot program
could be used that reads pairs of numbers from standard input and
plots them (in some cases, a blank line is present to indicate the
start of a new sub-plot).  My version of the 'graph' program, from my
version of 'plotutils', has been designed to work well for this
application.  (Use it with the -n option, for new defaults, and with
the -p1 option if you want small points rather than lines).  You can
get this program at github.com/radfordneal/plotutils.  An older
possibility is the "xgraph" program written by David Harrison, which
can be obtained from my web page at www.cs.utoronto.ca/~radford.

If you lack a plot program that can be used in this convenient way,
you can redirect the output to a file (eg, "net-plt t l log &gt;file")
and then read this file into whatever plotting program you have.  As a
last resort, you can just look at the numbers in the file yourself.

All the data sets mentioned here are present in directories with names
beginning with "ex", along with the C source of the programs that
generated the data.  The commands given assume that you are in the
directory containing the data.  The command sequences used for each
example are also stored in these directories, in shell files with the
names like 'rcmds.net', 'rcmds.gp', 'bcmds.net', 'bcmds.gp', etc.
Some of these directories also contain other command files used for
examples in my papers.

Computation times are given for many of the examples.  These are all
for the current version of the software, run on the system described
in <A HREF="Ex-test-system.html">Ex-test-system.doc</A>.
