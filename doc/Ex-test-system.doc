THE COMPUTER SYSTEM USED FOR THE EXAMPLES

The software runs mentioned in the examples were done on a Lenovo

ThreadRipper PRO 3945WX processor, with 12 cores (only one of which is
used for most of the examples).

The operating system used was Ubuntu 20.04.

The compiler used was gcc 9.  The compilation options were the
defaults in make.include and make-all.  In particular, double
