INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE

This section describes how to unpack and compile the software for a
Unix/Linux/macOS machine.  Note that getting the software to work in a
different environment may be difficult or impossible.


Unpacking the files.

The software is distributed as a Unix tar archive.  You should
download the tar archive for the desired version from my web page at
www.cs.utoronto.ca/~radford/fbm.software.html via your Web browser, or
using 'wget', saving it in a file with a name of the form
'fbm.YYYY-MM-DD.tar', and then issue the command

    tar xf fbm.YYYY-MM-DD.tar

The following instructions cover what to do next for the current
version; you should read the old documentation if for some reason you
are installing an older version.

The tar command should create a directory called 'fbm.YYYY-MM-DD',
where YYYY-MM-DD is the release date.  It should place numerous files
and sub-directories in this directory.  If this seems to have worked,
you can remove the file 'fbm.YYYY-MM-DD.tar'.  You should now change
into the 'fbm.YYYY-MM-DD' directory, as the following instructions
assumed that you are there.

If you prefer that this directory be called something other than
'fbm.YYYY-MM-DD', change the name now, BEFORE compiling the programs,
since the programs look for a file of random numbers in the directory
under the name it had when they were compiled.


Looking at the documentation.

The directory 'doc' contains all the documentation files, or links to
them.  The source for the documentation is in the various .doc files.
Files of the form 'Release.YYYY-MM-DD.doc' contain information on
current and past releases.  These may be of interest if you are
upgrading from an older version of the software.

The documentation is most conveniently access via a web browser,
starting with the file 'index.html' in the 'doc' directory.  The
various .doc files have .html versions (automatically created),
which are linked to from index.html.


Compiling the programs.

Compling the programs requires a C development environment.  On a
Linux system, you may need to use 

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

On a macOS system, you may need

    xcode-select --install

Installing further things may also be necessary; the details will vary
with your exact system.

Once the build tools are installed, you will probably be able to
compile the programs as described below without having to change
anything.  However, it is possible that you will want to use a
different C compiler, or set certain compilation options.  You can
probably set the required options by modifying the 'make.include' file
in the main directory, which is included at the beginning of all
Makefiles, though for some problems you might have to modify the
'Makefile' and 'xxx.make' files in the various sub-directories, or
modify the source files.

Here are some reasons that you might need to customize things:

  1) The programs are written in C as defined by the C99 standard.  If
     you compiler defaults to some other idea of what C is, you should
     try to persuade it otherwise

  2) The programs were written with IEEE floating-point in mind, and
     therefore may occasionally perform operations that result in
     overflow or underflow.  If this causes program termination on
     your machine (eg, with a "floating point exception"), you will
     need to figure out how to disable these errors. 

  3) You might want to change the settings of the options for use of
     vector instructions on some machines, as described in comments
     in make.include.

  4) The 'util' directory contains a file of 100,000 natural random
     bytes, which are used in combination with pseudo-random numbers
     This file is accessed by many of the programs, using a path 
     name that by default points into this 'util' directory.  If you 
     plan on moving this file elsewhere, you will need to change the 
     compilation command for rand.c at the end of 'util/util.make'.

  5) If you are rather short of memory, you might want to reduce the
     size of the Max_optional_memory constant defined in gp/gp-mc.c.
     This will save memory at the cost of some time.

Once you have made any required changes, you can compile the programs
by going to the main directory where you installed the software and
issuing the command

    make-all

This will compile programs in the various sub-directories.  Note that
some modules will be compiled over again in each directory where they
are used; this is intentional.

It is possible that these compilation commands will fail for some
reason, in which case you'll have to figure out what's wrong and fix
it.  Note that the 'make-all' command just moves into each of the
directories and does a 'make' there.  You can do this manually for
each directory to see where the problem is.  For these makes to work
correctly, the programs MUST be kept in separate 'util', 'mc', 'dist',
'bvg', 'net', 'gp', and 'mix' sub-directories, with these names.


Using the programs.

Once you have successfully compiled the programs, you should put the
'bin' directory (within the main directory for this software) in your
search path.  How this is done depends on the shell program you are
using.  This directory contains symbolic links to all the programs
making up this software.  Subsequent instructions assume that you have
this 'bin' directory in your search path.

The above is the simple version of how to use the programs.  However,
if you want to use the programs on more than one type of machine, you
will need to compile them several times, once for each machine
architecture (do a 'make-clean', as described below, before
re-compiling for a new architecture).  You will also need to set your
search path to a directory that contains the versions of the programs
compiled for the machine you are currently using.  By convention,
these directories should be called "bin.ARCH", where ARCH is the name
of the machine architecture.  The shell file install-arch creates such
a directory (if necessary) and copies the programs from the "bin"
directory to the "bin.ARCH" directory for the current architecture.
It is assumed that a program called 'arch' exists that returns the
name of the architecture.


Cleaning things up.

Once the compilations have finished, you can save some disk space by
issuing the command

    rm */*.o

when you are in the main directory.  You can get rid of the compiled
programs by using the command

    make-clean

when in the main directory.  Of course, you then won't be able to use
the programs until you do another make-all to recompile them, unless
you had copied them to a "bin.ARCH" directory.
