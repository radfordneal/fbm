This directory contains links to the .doc files documenting commands,
and the .doc files with the tutorial examples.  The command

    make-html *.doc

will convert all of these into the corresponding .html files.

The file index.html is the starting point for the documentation, with
links to all the other .html files.

The net-models.PDF file is created from net-models.tex as follows:

    pdflatex net-models; mv net-models.pdf net-models.PDF

(The upper case for .PDF helps make-html distinguish this local PDF
file from links to .pdf files elsewhere.)
