Neural network models.

Details of the currently-implemented network architectures are
described in the documentation here in net-models.PDF.

For a more extensive description of Bayesian neural network models and
their implementation, see my book (based on my PhD thesis):

  Neal, R. M. (1996) Bayesian Learning for Neural Networks, Lecture
  Notes in Statistics No. 118, New York: Springer-Verlag.

Neural network learning using gradient descent, early stopping, and
ensembles is discussed in the following paper:

  Neal, R. M. (1998) ``Assessing relevance determination methods using
  DELVE'', in C. M. Bishop (editor), Neural Networks and Machine
  Learning, pp. 97-129, Springer-Verlag.

I discussed neural network survival analysis models in this talk:

  network'', Joint Statistical Meetings, August 2001.  Slides
  available at http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~radford/ftp/nnsv-talk.pdf

prediction competitions are available here:

  diffusion trees'', in J. M. Bernardo, et al. (editors) Bayesian
  Statistics 7, pp. 619-629.
