NOTES ON THE VERSION UNDER DEVELOPMENT


Documentation changes in this version.

None yet.


Feature changes in the version:

1) A new xxx-avepred script can be used to plot how error using
   predictions averaged over a window of iterations changes during a
   run.  See xxx-avepred.doc.

2) The net-display program can now display parameters or hyperparameters
   in only a single group.  See net-display.doc for details.

3) A network configuration "file" can now be specified as the concatenation
   of several files, with names separated by commas, or by literal strings
   in such a specification.  See net-spec.doc for details.

4) A variable in a configuration file can now be changed by
   multiplication or division using an item such as X/2 (to divide X
   by 2) or X*3 (to multiply X by 3).  The += and -= operators are
   also now implemented.  A ?= operator assigns conditional on the
   variable currently being zero.  See net-config.doc for details.

5) The directory 'configs' now contains some pre-defined configuration
   files (eg, for convolution).  This directory is looked in if a
   configuration file cannot be opened directly.

6) The way net-spec displays hidden and output unit adjustments has
   changed - they are now displayed separately in order with other
   groups.


Performance changes in this version:

None yet.


Bug fixes.

1) Fixed bug in net-spec concerning display of sizes of weights from
   inputs when there was an omit option.


Known bugs and other deficiencies.

1) The facility for plotting quantities using "plot" operations in xxx-mc
   doesn't always work for the first run of xxx-mc (before any
   iterations exist in the log file).  A work-around is to do a run of
   xxx-mc to produce just one iteration before attempting a run of
   xxx-mc that does any "plot" operations.

2) The CPU time features (eg, the "k" quantity) will not work correctly
   if a single iteration takes more than about 71 minutes.

3) The latent value update operations for Gaussian processes may recompute 
   the inverse covariance matrix even when an up-to-date version was 
   computed for the previous Monte Carlo operation.

4) Covariance matrices are stored in full, even though they are symmetric,
   which sometimes costs a factor of two in memory usage.

5) Giving net-pred several log files that have different network architectures
   doesn't work, but an error message is not always produced (the results may
   just be nonsense).

6) Some Markov chain updates for Dirichlet diffusion tree models in which 
   there is no data model (ie, no noise) are not implemented when some of 
   the data is missing.  An error message is produced in such cases.

7) When prediction windows overlap in xxx-avepred, so predictions for
   some iterations are used in several windows, these predictions are
   inefficiently recomputed for each use.
