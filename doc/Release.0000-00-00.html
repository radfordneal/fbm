NOTES ON THE VERSION UNDER DEVELOPMENT


Documentation changes in this version.

None yet.


Feature changes in the version:

1) Priors for groups of parameters in network models can now specify
   that the parameter is fixed at the sigma value, or at plus or minus
   the sigma value, by appending "!" or "!!" to the prior
   specification.  (The latter option was available before with "!",
   in a limited way.)  Initialization respects such priors, and
   stepsizes for such parameters are forced to zero, so that MCMC
   operations will not set them to values contrary to their prior.

   The "!" option is useful for setting up average pooling layers, for
   which the weights between the layers should be fixed.

2) A new xxx-avepred script can be used to plot how error using
   predictions averaged over a window of iterations changes during a
   run.  See <A HREF="xxx-avepred.html">xxx-avepred.doc</A>.

3) The net-display program can now display parameters or hyperparameters
   in only a single group.  See <A HREF="net-display.html">net-display.doc</A> for details.

4) A network configuration "file" can now be specified as the concatenation
   of several files, with names separated by commas, or by literal strings
   in such a specification.  See <A HREF="net-spec.html">net-spec.doc</A> for details.

5) A variable in a configuration file can now be changed by
   multiplication or division using an item such as X/2 (to divide X
   by 2) or X*3 (to multiply X by 3).  The += and -= operators are
   also now implemented.  A ?= operator assigns conditional on the
   variable currently being zero.  See <A HREF="net-config.html">net-config.doc</A> for details.

6) The directory 'configs' now contains some pre-defined configuration
   files (eg, for convolution).  This directory is looked in if a
   configuration file cannot be opened directly.

7) New u and U network quantities allow display of hidden unit values
   in training or test cases, or of averages of the absolute values
   of these units.

8) The net-spec command with "sizes" option now displays the number
   of connections in each group as well as the number of parameters
   (which may differ for configured groups).  It also displays the
   offset of each parameter group within the full set of parameters.

9) The way net-spec displays hidden and output unit adjustments has
   changed - they are now displayed separately in order with other
   groups.  Group numbers are now also displayed.

10) The dynamic and permuted-dynamic operations now take an optional
    -D option, which causes the change in energy to be recorded (at
    possible extra computational cost).  See <A HREF="mc-spec.html">mc-spec.doc</A> for details.

11) The dynamic and permuted-dynamic operations now take an optional
    -r option, which can be used to prevent unstable behaviour. See
    <A HREF="mc-spec.html">mc-spec.doc</A> for details.

12) The dynamic and permuted-dynamic operations can now update an
    adaptive factor for stepsizes, that can be used by dynamic,
    permuted-dynamic, and hybrid operations. One form of the hybrid
    operation also allows adaptation, using a different criterion.
    See <A HREF="mc-spec.html">mc-spec.doc</A> for details. 

13) A type of normalization layer is now implemented, similar to one
    component of the Filter Response Normalization (FRN) scheme of
    Saurabh Singh and Shankar Krishnan.  See <A HREF="net-spec.html">net-spec.doc</A> for details.

Performance changes in this version:

None yet.


Bug fixes.

1) Fixed bug in net-spec concerning display of sizes of weights from
   inputs when there was an omit option.

2) Fixed overflow problem when recording compute time.  Should now be
   OK for runs of no more than 24.85 days.


Known bugs and other deficiencies.

1) The facility for plotting quantities using "plot" operations in xxx-mc
   doesn't always work for the first run of xxx-mc (before any
   iterations exist in the log file).  A work-around is to do a run of
   xxx-mc to produce just one iteration before attempting a run of
   xxx-mc that does any "plot" operations.

2) Giving net-pred several log files that have different network architectures
   doesn't work, but an error message is not always produced (the results may
   just be nonsense).

3) The latent value update operations for Gaussian processes may recompute 
   the inverse covariance matrix even when an up-to-date version was 
   computed for the previous Monte Carlo operation.

4) Covariance matrices are stored in full, even though they are symmetric,
   which sometimes costs a factor of two in memory usage.

5) Some Markov chain updates for Dirichlet diffusion tree models in which 
   there is no data model (ie, no noise) are not implemented when some of 
   the data is missing.  An error message is produced in such cases.

6) When prediction windows overlap in xxx-avepred, so predictions for
   some iterations are used in several windows, these predictions are
   inefficiently recomputed for each use.
