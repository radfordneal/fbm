NOTES ON THE VERSION UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Changes in this version.

1) The tutorial examples have been updated, with timing results now
   given for a modern processor, with some plots now supplied as PNG 
   files, and with other updates and minor fixes.

2) For neural network models, the configuration of the connections and
   their weights into a hidden layer, from the input layer or the
   previous hidden layer, may now be set up explicitly, rather than
   (as previously) layers always being fully-connected, without weight
   sharing.  In particular, this allows for specification of models
   with convolutional layers.  See <A HREF="net-spec.html">net-spec.doc</A> and <A HREF="net-config.html">net-config.doc</A> for
   details, as well as the tutorial example in <A HREF="Ex-image.html">Ex-image.doc</A>.

3) Forward / backward / gradient computations for neural networks have
   been sped up, by rewriting the portable code to encourage the
   compiler to use vector instructions, and by (optionally) using
   specially-written code to exploit AVX instructions (with or without
   FMA), when available.

4) Computations for neural networks have also been sped up by using
   the SLEEF library for vectorized mathematical functions (eg, tanh).

5) The maximum number of hidden layers in a neural network is now 15
   (up from 7 before).

6) New C0, C1, and Cn for n&gt;1 quantities are now defined, to help assess
   how well metropolis and hybrid updates are exploring the distribution.
   (But note that these are masked for mixture models, where they have
   another meaning.)

7) The net-gen program has been extended to allow parameters to be set
   from standard input, rather than being set to zero, or randomly,

8) The maximum number of iterations that can be used when making predictions
   with the median has been increased from 200 to 1000.

Bug fixes.

1) Fixed a bug in network function evaluation when input offsets are
   present and connections from some inputs are omitted.

2) Documentation for the 'plot' mc operation has been corrected.

3) Incorrect prior specification (not matching ccmds.net) corrected in
   Ex_<A HREF="netgp-c.html">netgp-c.doc</A> (and Ex_netgp-c.html).

Known bugs and other deficiencies.

1) The facility for plotting quantities using "plot" operations in xxx-mc
   doesn't always work for the first run of xxx-mc (before any
   iterations exist in the log file).  A work-around is to do a run of
   xxx-mc to produce just one iteration before attempting a run of
   xxx-mc that does any "plot" operations.

2) The CPU time features (eg, the "k" quantity) will not work correctly
   if a single iteration takes more than about 71 minutes.

3) The latent value update operations for Gaussian processes may recompute 
   the inverse covariance matrix even when an up-to-date version was 
   computed for the previous Monte Carlo operation.

4) Covariance matrices are stored in full, even though they are symmetric,
   which sometimes costs a factor of two in memory usage.

5) Giving net-pred several log files that have different network architectures
   doesn't work, but an error message is not always produced (the results may
   just be nonsense).

6) Some Markov chain updates for Dirichlet diffusion tree models in which 
   there is no data model (ie, no noise) are not implemented when some of 
   the data is missing.  An error message is produced in such cases.

7) The times given in the documentation for the examples are for a
   very old computer.  Typical current (2020) desktop computers will
   be at least 20 times faster.
