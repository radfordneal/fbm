NOTES ON THE VERSION UNDER DEVELOPMENT


Documentation changes in this version.

None yet.


Feature changes in the version:

1) New xxx-avepred scripts for plotting how error
   using averaged predictions changes during a run.  (More doc to come.)


Performance changes in this version:

None yet.


Bug fixes.

None yet.


Known bugs and other deficiencies.

1) The facility for plotting quantities using "plot" operations in xxx-mc
   doesn't always work for the first run of xxx-mc (before any
   iterations exist in the log file).  A work-around is to do a run of
   xxx-mc to produce just one iteration before attempting a run of
   xxx-mc that does any "plot" operations.

2) The CPU time features (eg, the "k" quantity) will not work correctly
   if a single iteration takes more than about 71 minutes.

3) The latent value update operations for Gaussian processes may recompute 
   the inverse covariance matrix even when an up-to-date version was 
   computed for the previous Monte Carlo operation.

4) Covariance matrices are stored in full, even though they are symmetric,
   which sometimes costs a factor of two in memory usage.

5) Giving net-pred several log files that have different network architectures
   doesn't work, but an error message is not always produced (the results may
   just be nonsense).

6) Some Markov chain updates for Dirichlet diffusion tree models in which 
   there is no data model (ie, no noise) are not implemented when some of 
   the data is missing.  An error message is produced in such cases.
