DATA-SPEC:  Specify data sets for training and testing.

Data-spec writes specifications of data sets to use for training and
testing to the given log file (which must already exist).  If invoked
with just a log file as argument, the program prints the data
specifications already stored in the log file.

Usage:

    data-spec log-file N-inputs N-targets [ int-target ] [ -n | -e ]
                / train-inputs train-targets [ test-inputs [ test-targets ] ]
              [ / { input-trans } [ / { target-trans } ] ]

or:

    data-spec log-file

The number of "input" and "target" values must be specified.  The
number of inputs or targets may be zero, although some other programs
may not allow this.  The user can require the targets to be integers
by including an 'int-target' argument.  The permitted range of these
integer targets is from zero to 'int-target' minus one, if
'int-target' is a postive integer, or from zero on up, if 'int-target'
is "+", or any integer (positive, zero, or negative) if 'int-target'
is "-".

The training and (optionally) test sets are given in the form of
specifications described in <A HREF="numin.html">numin.doc</A>.  The default specification for
training and test inputs is "data@1,1".  The training input
specification provides the default for the training target
specification - i.e. the file and line range used for the inputs is
used for targets if not overridden, and the item indexes for the
targets start by default after the last index for the inputs.
Similarly, the test input specification is used as the default for the
test targets.

The data files are read and checked for errors, unless the "-n" option
was included before the file specifications.  If the data is checked,
the number of lines of training inputs must match the number of lines
of training targets, and similarly for test inputs and targets.  If
the "-e" option is included, the training data and test data (if
provided) are echoed to standard output after being read.

The final optional arguments specify the transformations to be applied
to inputs and targets.  A transformation specification has one of the
four forms

           [L][+T][xS]  or  [L][-T][xS]  or  I  or  ...

If "L" is present in the first two forms, the raw data is first
transformed by taking the logarithm.  T is then added or subtracted
(default 0), and the result multiplied by S (default 1).  The "I" form
specifies an identity transformation.  The "..."  form is valid only
at the end of a list of transformations, and indicates that the
transformation specifications for any remaining inputs or targets
(whichever the list pertains to) should be the same as the
specification preceding "...".  If "..." does not occur at the end of
a list of transformations, the transformation specification for any
remaining inputs or targets defaults to "I".

The translation and scaling amounts ("T" and "S") may be "@", in which
case they are computed from the training data, so as to produce a mean
of zero (for translation), or a variance of one (for scaling).  This
is not allowed in conjunction with the "-n" option.

The specifications are written to the log file as a record with type
'D' and index -1.
