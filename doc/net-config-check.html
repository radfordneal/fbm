NET-CONFIG-CHECK:  Check/display a network configuration specification.

Net-config-check reads a file containing a specification of network
connections, as might be used for a "config:" option in a network
specification (see <A HREF="net-spec.html">net-spec.doc</A>), checks it for errors, and optionally
displays the connections it specifies on standard output.

Usage:

    net-config-check [ -p ] [ -i | -I ] config-file [ ns ] nd

Reads the specified configuration file, checks it for errors, and
displays the connections specified on standard output if the -p option
is given.  Any errors found, and the output from any "@" directives in
the specification, are displayed on standard error.  In addition, if
the -i option is specified, some information (useful for debugging)
regarding the specified connections is written to standard error, even
more if -I is specified.  The number of source units, ns, and the
number of destination units, nd, must be specified, with ns omitted if
the specification is for bias connections.  

The configuation file specified may in fact be multiple files (or
shell commands) and/or literal strings, as described in <A HREF="net-spec.html">net-spec.doc</A>.
