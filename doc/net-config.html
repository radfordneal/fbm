NET-CONFIG:  Specify weight configuration for a layer's connections

What connections exist into a hidden layer of a network from the
previous hidden layer or the input layer, and any sharing of weights
between these connections, can be specified in a configuration file,
referenced from the "input-config" or "hidden-config" flags in the
network specification.  (See <A HREF="net-spec.html">net-spec.doc</A> for details.)

This configure file contains one or more triples of the form 

    &lt;source-unit&gt; &lt;destination-unit&gt; &lt;weight-index&gt;

These elements may be positive integers. The source unit ranges from 1
to the number of units in the source layer (the input layer or the
previous hidden layer).  The destimation unit ranges from 1 to the
number of units in the hidden layer this configuration applies to.
The weight-index ranges from 1 to the number of weights used, which
may be less than the number of connections, since weights may be
shared.

For example, suppose the following network specification is used:

    net-spec log 3 1 input-config:conf / io=2

and the file "config" contains the following lines:

    1 1 1
    1 2 2
    1 3 1

Then the network will have two weight parameters, with the first
parameter being used for the connections from the first and third
input to the output, and the second parameters being used for the
connection from the second input to the output.
