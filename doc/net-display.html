NET-DISPLAY:  Print network parameters and/or hyperparameters.

Net-display prints the parameters (weights, biases, and offsets)
and/or the hyperparameters (sigmas) of the network.

Usage:

    net-display [ -p | -h | -P ] log-file [ index ]

If no index is specified, the last network in the log file is
displayed.  By default, the parameters and hyperparameters are both
displayed.  The -p option (or -w option) causes only the parameters
(weights) to be displayed (to higher precision).  The -h option (or -s
option) causes only the hyperparameters (sigmas) to be displayed.  The
-P option causes only parameters to be printed, in a raw format
without headers, one per line, in high precision.

The output of the program (except when -P is specified) consists of
one section for each type of parameter, plus a section for noise
levels, if a regression data model is being used.  The format of a
section is best described by looking at the section for the weights
from input units to output units, which is as follows, for a net with
three input units and four output units, when no option is specified.

  Input to Output Weights [1]

    Common-sigma Unit-sigma:  Weight Weight Weight Weight

                 Unit-sigma:  Weight Weight Weight Weight

                 Unit-sigma:  Weight Weight Weight Weight

The sigma values associated with this type of parameter are at the
left, before the colons.  The top-level sigma is at the top left;
sigmas associated with each source unit appear just to the right, on
separate lines.  After the sigma for each unit are listed the weights
out of that unit.  The sigma values associated with each weight are
not displayed (neither are they explicitly represented in the file).
The number in square brackets at the end of the title is the group
number, useful in net-plt.

For biases and offsets, this basic format is modified, since the
unit-level sigma values are not explicitly represented; the common
sigma is shown in the unit sigma column instead.

When -p is specified, the format is the same, except that the sigmas
are missing, allowing the parameters to be displayed to higher precision.

When -h is specified, the format is as follows:

  Input to Output Weights [1]

    Common-sigma - Unit-sigma Unit-sigma Unit-sigma
                   Unit-sigma Unit-sigma Unit-sigma

and similarly for other groups.  This is also the format used for the
noise sigmas.

When a group of connection weights or biases are configured via a
configuration file specified by net-spec, the weights are shown in
their index order in the configuration, which may have nothing to do
with their source or destination units.  Note that these weights may
be shared by more than one connection.
