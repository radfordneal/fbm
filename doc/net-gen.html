NET-GEN:  Generate networks randomly from the prior, or with fixed values.  

Net-gen writes a series of independently-generated networks to a log
file, with the architecture specified in that log file.

Usage:

    net-gen log-file [ max-index ] [ "fix" [ value [ out-value ] ] ]
                     [ "zero" | "rand" | "-" ] [ "zero" | "rand" | "-" ]

The networks with indexes from zero up to the indicated index are
generated (the default is max-index of zero).  If the log file already
contains networks with some of these indexes, only the networks with
indexes greater than the last one in the log file are generated.

If just max-index is specified, the network hyperparametrs are
generated randomly from the prior, using the random number seed taken
from the log file (eg, as specified by rand-seed), and network
parameters are then generated randomly based on the generated
hyperparameters.

Random generation can be overridden by later options.

When "fix" is given, the hyperparameters are not generated at random,
but rather are set to 'value', except that hyperparameters controlling
connections to outputs are set to 'out-value', if specified.  If
'value' is not specified, the hyperparameters are each set to the
top-level width for that hyperparameter (and this is also true even if
'value' is specified when the prior does not allow any other value).

Arguments of "zero", "rand", or "-" can be used to specify how
parameters are generated, with "zero" specifying that they are set to
zero, "rand" specifying that they are generated randomly based on the
hyperparameters that were chosen, and "-" specifying that they are
read from standard input.  The default is "rand", unless "fix" is
specified, in which case the default is "zero".  If a second argument
of this form is given, it applies to parameters on connections to the
outputs; if no such argument is given, these connections are treated
the same as the others.

No data model is required to use net-gen, but if a model is specified,
the hyperparameters with it are generated as well (with any "fix"
option ignored for these hyperparameters).

Two records are written for every network generated - an 'S' record
containing the hyperparameters ('sigma' values), and a 'W' record
containing the parameters (weights, biases, and offsets).  An 'r'
record recording the random number generator state is written as well
if any parameters were randomly generated.
