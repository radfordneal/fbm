NET-GEN:  Generate networks randomly from the prior, or with fixed values.  

Net-gen writes a series of independently-generated networks to a log
file, with the architecture specified in that log file.

Usage:

    net-gen log-file [ max-index ] [ "fix" [ value [ out-value ] ] [ "-" ] ]

The networks with indexes from zero up to the indicated index are
generated (the default is max-index of zero).  If the log file already
contains networks with some of these indexes, only the networks with
indexes greater than the last one in the log file are generated.

If just max-index is specified, the networks are generated randomly
from the prior, using the random number seed taken from the log file
(eg, as specified by rand-seed).

The "fix" option is useful for initializing iterative programs, and
for testing.  When "fix" is given, the networks are not generated at
random, but rather the hyperparameters are set to 'value', except that
hyperparameters controlling connections to outputs are set to
'out-value', if specified.  If 'value' is not specified, the
hyperparameters are each set to the top-level width for that
hyperparameter (and this is also true if the prior does not allow any
other value).  All parameters are set to zero, unless "-" is the last
argument, in which case they are read from standard input.

No data model is required to use net-gen, but if a model is specified,
the hyperparameters with it are generated as well.

Two records are written for every network generated - an 'S' record
containing the hyperparameters ('sigma' values), and a 'W' record
containing the parameters (weights, biases, and offsets).  An 'r'
record recording the random number generator state is written as well
(unless "fix" was used).
