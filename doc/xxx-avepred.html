XXX-AVEPRED:  Show predive performance using a series of windows of states

There is a version of this program for each application that has an
xxx-pred program (eg, net-pred), which is called repeatedly by this
program.

Usage:

    xxx-avepred [ "p" | "n" | "m" ] log-file start [ iters [ step [ end ] ] ]
                [ / test-inputs test-targets ]

where 'xxx' is the application (eg, 'net').  The "p", "n", or "m"
argument specifies whether the predictions will be assessed by log
probability, by squared error based on a mean prediction, or by
classification error based on the modal prediction.  Some of these
options are not valid for some applications or models.

The output consists of some number of lines, which each contain an
iteration number (beginning with 'start') and the performance (by the
specified measure) of predictions that use a window of iterations from
the log file ending at that iteration and beginning 'iters' minus one
iterations before (so if all iterations are present in the log file,
the predictions will be based on 'iters' iterations).  Succesive
prediction windows will be offset by 'step', ending when the last
iteration of the window would be greater than 'end'.

The default for 'iters' is 'start', the default for 'step' is 'iters',
and the default for 'end' is the last iteration in the log file.

The source for the inputs and targets on which performance is assessed
can be specified after a "/" argument, as for xxx-pred.  The default
is to use the test cases specified previously with data-spec (if any).

The output is suitable for use by any plot program that would also be
suitable for use with xxx-plt.

Examples:  

  xxx-avepred n lg 20 5 10 55

    This will output squared errors when using mean predictions, for
    predictions based on iterations 16-20, 26-30, 36-40, and 46-50
    from the log file "lg".

  xxx-avepred p lg 10

    This will output the average log probability for targets, when
    using probabilities averaged over 10 iterations, for windows of
    iterations starting with iterations 1-10, then iterations 11-20,
    and so forth, until the end of the log file is reached.
