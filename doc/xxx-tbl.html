XXX-TBL:  Write quantities from log files in a tabular form.

There is a version of this program for each application (eg, net-tbl).
Each version allows a table to be created containing quantities
defined for that application.  The table is written to standard
output, and hence will be displayed for viewing if not redirected.

This tabular output may also be useful as input to some plotting
programs, or as input to a statistical package (such as S-Plus), in
which case it should be redirected to a file, or piped into a plotting
program.  It may also be useful to pipe the output of xxx-tbl with
just one quantity into the 'series' program (see <A HREF="series.html">series.doc</A>).

Usage:
  
   xxx-tbl [ -h ] [ -f ] quantities { log-file [ range ] } [ / { app-args } ]

Here 'xxx' is a prefix identifying the particular incarnation of this
program.  The 'quantities' listed are put in the table, all one one
line in the order given.  Some quantities may be arrays, in which case
all values in the indicated range are included.  The log files from
which the data comes are listed after the quantities, perhaps with
ranges of iterations to use.  Depending on the application, further
arguments may follow after a slash (for which, see the documentation
specific to that application, such as <A HREF="net-tbl.html">net-tbl.doc</A>).

If the -h flag is present, a single header line will be output first,
containing the names of the quantities in the table.

A -f flag indicates that the last log file listed should be read with
retries after EOF is encountered (with a one second delay), so that
continuing runs will be followed.

Data comes from records with indexes in the specified ranges within
the log files mentioned.  The ranges have the form "[low][:[high]]][%mod]".  
The low bound defaults to one.  If no high bound is given, the range
extends to the highest index in the log file.  If the "%mod" option is
present, only iterations within the range whose index is a multiple of
"mod" are used (e.g. "5:12%3" is equivalent to 6 9 12).  If no range
is given, the default is "1:".

For the format of the quantity specifications, see the documentation
on quantities that are generic (<A HREF="quantities.html">quantities.doc</A>), for Monte Carlo runs
(<A HREF="mc-quantities.html">mc-quantities.doc</A>), for neural networks (<A HREF="net-quantities.html">net-quantities.doc</A>), for
Gaussian processes (<A HREF="gp-quantities.html">gp-quantities.doc</A>), etc.  

If a quantity mentioned is an array with indefinite range, this range
must be the same for all log files from which data comes.

NOTE FOR S-PLUS USERS:  If the output of xxx-tbl is saved in a file, 
say "x", it can be read into S-Plus with a command such as

    &gt; x &lt;- read.table("x")

If the -h flag was used, the following S-Plus command should be used:

    &gt; x &lt;- read.table("x",headers=T)
