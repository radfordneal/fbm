This directory contains command files for the examples of Markov
sampling from simple distributions.  The command files match the
commands given in the documentation, except that the stepsize to use
is given as an argument to the command file.  The log files include
the stepsize as part of the name.

The 'grun' command file does all the runs for the examples in Ex-dist-g.doc.

Command files for sampling from the "funnel" distribution used in
Ex-dist-f.doc and as an example in my paper on "Slice Sampling" in
Annals of Statistics are also included.  The 'frun' command file runs
all these examples.  (An earlier version of this paper is available as
a technical report from my web page.)
