# Commands to sample from the "ring" distribution using multivariate
# slice sampling, with shrinkage in all directions.  The stepsize to use 
# is given as an argument.  Thirteen slice sampling operation are done per 
# iteration, which takes about 53 function evaluations when the stepsize 
# is 5.
