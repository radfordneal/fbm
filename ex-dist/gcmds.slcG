# Commands to sample from the "ring" distribution using multivariate
# slice sampling, with shrinkage in the direction where the product of
# gradient and width is greatest in magnitude.  The stepsize to use is 
# given as an argument.  Nine slice sampling operation are done per 
# iteration, which takes about 45 function and gradient evaluations when 
# the stepsize is 5.
