# Commands to sample from the "ring" distribution using single variable
# slice sampling.  The stepsize to use is given as an argument.  Two
# slice sampling operation are done per iteration, which takes about 72
# function evaluations when the stepsize is 0.2.  (This is a bit more than
# needed to match the other command files, but you can't repeat 1.5 times.)
