# Commands to sample from the "ring" distribution using single variable
# slice sampling.  The stepsize to use is given as an argument.  Four
# slice sampling operation are done per iteration, which takes about 60
# function evaluations when the stepsize is either 1 or 5.  (This is 
# slightly more than needed to equalize times with other command files.)
