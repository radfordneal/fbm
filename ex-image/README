This directory contains data files, command files, and generation
programs for the examples of image models.  To play with the data as
in the manual, all you need to use are the data and command files (eg,
idata-train and icmds1.net).  If you want to change the way the data
was generated, you'll need to recompile the generation program, which
is done with a command such as the following:

   cc igen.c rand.c -DRAND_FILE=\"../util/randfile\" -lm -o igen

and then run it to produce idata (on standard output).  Information is
also printed on standard error, more if an argument is given to igen.

Note that idata-train and idata-test are just the first 1536 and last
2464 lines of idata.
