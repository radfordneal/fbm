This directory contains data files, command files, and generation
programs for the examples of image models.  To play with the data as
in the manual, all you need to use are the data and command files (eg,
idata and icmds1.net).  If you want to change the way the data was
generated, you'll need to recompile the generation program, which is
done with a command such as the following:

   cc igen.c rand.c -DRAND_FILE=\"../util/randfile\" -lm -o igen
