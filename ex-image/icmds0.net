# Commands to apply Bayesian neural network to an image classification problem.
# This version uses uses a simple linear logistic model, which is not expected
# to perform at all well (but should be better than uniform guessing).
#
# Four runs are done, each on three quarters of the training set, with
# the left-out quarters used to assess things like convergence.  Final
# testing is done on the cases not in the training set.
