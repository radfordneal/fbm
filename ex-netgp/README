This directory contains data files, command files, and generation
programs for the examples of Bayesian learning for neural network and
Gaussian process models.  To play with the data as in the
documentation, all you need to use are the data and command files (eg,
rdata and rcmds.net).  If you want to change the way the data was
generated, you'll need to recompile the programs, which is done with a
command such as the following:

   cc rgen.c rand.c -DRAND_FILE=\"../util/randfile\" -lm -o rgen

The command files ending with ".old-style" do the same things using
the old syntax for net-spec (which still works).
