This directory contains data files, command files, and generation
programs for the examples of survival analysis using Bayesian neural
networks.  To play with the data as in the documentation, all you need
to use are the data and command files (eg, cdata and ccmds.net).  If
you want to change the way the data was generated, you'll need to
recompile the programs, which is done with a command such as the
following:

   cc cgen.c rand.c -DRAND_FILE=\"../util/randfile\" -lm -o cgen

The cmed.c and vmed.c programs compute the median time of death for
the same covariate values as in the data.  The output of these
programs is in 'cmedians' and 'vmedians'.

The subdirectory "pbc" contains files relating to the example used in
my talk on "Survival analysis using a Bayesian neural network" at the
2001 Joint Statistical Meetings in Atlanta.
