XXX-GRAD-TEST:  Test the correctness of the energy gradient computations.

There is a version of this program for each 'mc' application (eg,
net-grad-test).  These programs are used to check the energy gradient
computed by the application-specific 'mc' module against that found by
taking differences using the straight energy computation procedure of
the same module.

If there is a GPU version of the xxx-mc program, there will also be a
GPU version of xxx-grad-test, so that gradient computations on the GPU
can be tested.

These programs are meant for debugging, not for ordinary use.

Usage:

    xxx-grad-test log-file index delta [ "-" | pix ]
 
Here 'xxx' is a prefix identifying the particular incarnation of this
program.  The energy and gradient computations are tested at the point
stored with the specified index in the log file.  The gradient is
compared to the gradient found using finite differences of the energy
with the given difference value.  If the optional final argument is
"-", only the energy is computed (and displayed).  If a parameter
index 'pix' (from 0) is given as the optional final argument, only the
component of the gradient with that index is checked.  (This is much
faster that checking the full gradient for high-dimensional problems.)

The results are written to standard output.
