NET-CONFIG:  Specify weight configuration for a layer's connections

By default, units in one layer of a network are fully connected to
units in a layer that feeds into it.  Alternatively, for hidden and
output layers, one can use a configuration file to specify what
connections exist from the previous hidden layer (or any hidden layer
for outputs) or from the input layer, as well as any sharing of
weights between these connections.  Similarly, biases for hidden
layers and the outputs may be configured with sharing or sparsity.
The configuration files to use are specified by "config:" options in
the network specification.  See net-spec.doc for details.

The net-config-check command can be used to check for errors and
display information regarding a configuration file, as described in
net-config-check.doc.

The 'configs' directory contains soem pre-defined configuration files.
If a configuration file is not found at the path given in net-spec, it
is looked for in this directory.

Configuration files can be written in various ways, as given by the
detailed syntax at the end of this document.  The simplest form, as a
sequence of source-destination-weight triplets, is presented first
below, followed by increasingly elaborate forms.  Configuration files
for biases have the same form as those for input-to-hidden,
hidden-to-hidden, or hidden-to-output connections, except the
source-destination-weight triplets are replaced by unit-bias doublets.

Configuration files may be the output of a command, if specified with
"%", or be the result of concatenating several files, or literal
string.  See net-spec.doc for details.  

These configuration files can contain one or more triplets of the form

    <source-unit> <destination-unit> <weight-index>

These elements may be positive integers. The source unit ranges from 1
to the number of units in the source layer (either the input layer or
a hidden layer).  The destination unit ranges from 1 to the number of
units in the hidden or output layer this configuration applies to.
The weight-index ranges from 1 to the number of weights used, which
may be less (or, unusally, more) than the number of connections, since
weights may be shared.

As an example, suppose the following network specification is used:

    net-spec log 2 3 1 / ih=2 config:conf ho=3

and the file "conf" contains the following:

    1 1 1
    1 2 2
    2 1 2
    1 3 1  # The last one!

Note that the line breaks are not significant, but help readability.
A '#' causes the rest of the line to be ignored as a comment.

This network will have two parameters for input-to-hidden weights,
with the first parameter being used for the connections from the first
input to the first and third hidden unit, and the second parameter
being used for the connection from the first input to the second
hidden unit, and from the second input to the first hidden unit.

A connection from one unit to another may be associated with zero,
one, or more than one weight, with multiple weights having an additive
effect.  If no weight is associated with a connection, it is
effectivly absent from the network.

Indexes for units or weights may be specified relative to the values
in the previous triplet, using the form +offset or -offset.  A "+" with
no offset is the same as "+1", and a "-" with no offset is the same as
"-1".  An index specifed as "=" is the same as the previous index.
The previous index is considered to be 0 at the start of the file.

For example, the following configuration file has the same effect as
the one above:

    + + 1
    = + +
    + -1 =
    1 +2 -

A number may also be written in parts separated by "+" or "-".  For
example, the last item above could be written as follows:

    7-6 +102-100 -

or as follows:

    1 +20+30-48 -10+9

A group of triplets may be repeated by enclosing it in items of the
form "<rep>(" and ")", where <rep> is a positive integer (defaulting
to 1 if absent).  Such repeated groups may be nested.  A group of
triplets enclosed by "<rep>[" and "]" will update the indexes used for
relative values, but without producing any connections.  A group of
triplets enclosed by "<rep>{" and "}" will act like one enclosed by
"<rep>(" and ")" except that, after all repetitions, the indexes used
for relative values will be restored to ther values before the repeat
group.

The utility of relative specifications and grouping is illustrated by
the following network specification, which sets up a network that
computes a convolution of an input sequence of length 10 with a
3-point linear filter, which is then used in a logistic regression
model for binary classification:

    net-spec log 10 8 identity 1 / ih=1 config:filter ho=1 bo=1
    model-spec log binary

where the file "filter" contains

    1 1 1   + = +   + = +
    - + 1   + = +   + = +
    - + 1   + = +   + = +
    - + 1   + = +   + = +
    - + 1   + = +   + = +
    - + 1   + = +   + = +
    - + 1   + = +   + = +
    - + 1   + = +   + = +

Note that there are only three input-hidden weights in this model,
although there are 24 input-hidden connections in use, and 80 possible
input-hidden connections.

This configuration file can be abbreviated by using the repetition
facility, as follows:

    1 1 1   2( + = + )   7(  - + 1   2( + = + )  )

Using no-connection groups, this can be further abbreviated to

    [ 2 0 0 ]   8(  [ -2 + 0 ]   3( + = + )  )

Another way to specify the same configuration is as follows:

    8(  + + 1  2{  + = +  } )

Numbers may be specified using single-letter symbols, to which values
are assigned by items of the form <letter>=<number>.  Numbers may also
be combined with "+" or "-".  For example, the above may instead be
written as

    R=8  s=3 
    R(  + + 1  s-1{  + = +  } )

Letters have the value zero before any assignment, and may be assigned
more than once - for example, a=3 a=a+1 is allowed, and leaves a with
the value 4.  The assignment operators '+=' and '-=' are allowed, with
a+=3, for example, being the same as a=a+3.

The value stored for a letter may be changed by multiplying by a
value, using an assignment with '*=' rather than '='.  For example,

    x=4  x*=3

will set x to 12.  The value stored for a letter may also be changed
by dividing by a positive value (truncating any remainder), using an
assignment with '/=' rather than '='.  For example,

    x=17  x/=x-14

will set x to 5 (since x-14 is 3, and 17 divided by 3 is 5, discarding
the remainder).  It is an error for the divisor to be zero or
negative.  Note that '*' and '/' are not allowed as operators outside
this type of assignment.

An assignment with '?=' is done only if the variable is currently
zero.  This is useful for setting defaults, since variables are
initialized to zero.

Finally, an item of "@" (not in the middle of a triplet) will print 

    n @ s d w

on standard error, with n being an index from 1 up, and s, d, and w
being the current source unit, destination unit, and weight index.
This is for use in debugging configuration files.

The way in which triplets defining connections are produced by the
configuration file has no effect on the performance of network
operations.  (There may be a negligible effect on program startup
time.)  However, the way in which weights are associated with indexes
can have an effect on performance.  For example, it may be beneficial
for the indexes of weights on connections to consecutive units to be
consecutive.

The complete syntax for a configuration file can be written as
follows, with <.> for syntactic categories, | for alternatives, [.]
for optional parts, {.} for parts repeated zero or more times, and
double quotes for parts written literally:

    <configuration> : { <part> }

    <part>          : <triplet> 
                    | [<number>]"(" { <part> } ")"
                    | [<number>]"{" { <part> } "}"
                    | [<number>]"[" { <part> } "]"
                    | <letter>=<number>
                    | <letter>+=<number>
                    | <letter>-=<number>
                    | <letter>*=<number>
                    | <letter>/=<number>
                    | <letter>?=<number>
                    | "@"

    <triplet>       : <index> <index> <index>

    <index>         : <number> | <sign>[<number>]

    <number>        : <term>{<sign><term>}

    <term>          : <digits> | <letter>

    <sign>          : "+" | "-"

    <digits>        : <digit>{<digit>}

    <digit>         : "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"

    <letter>        : "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i"
                    | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r"
                    | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z"
                    | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I"
                    | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R"
                    | "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z"

Whitespace above corresponds to whitespace (spaces or newlines) in the
file, and lack of whitespace above corresponds to no whitespace in the
file.  For example, a repeated triplet must be written like 4( + + + ),
not like 4(+ + +) or 4 ( + + + ), and assignments must be written like
a=123, not like a = 123.

Configuration files for biases have the same syntax, except <triplet>
is replaced by <doublet>, defined as

    <doublet>: <index> <index>
