NET-EVAL:  Evaluate network functions for inputs from a file or on a grid.  

Net-eval displays the outputs and/or hidden unit values computed by a
set of networks, for inputs read from a file, or specified as a grid
of points.  Optionally, the outputs may instead be used to generate
target points at random in accordance with the data model.

Usage:

    net-eval [ -i ] [ -h[#] ] [ -o | -t ] log-file range / input-file 

or:

    net-eval [ -i ] [ -h[#] ] [ -o | -t ] log-file range { / low high sz } 

The net-eval program writes input values (unless -i is given), hidden
unit values for one or all hidden layers (if -h# or -h is given, with
# being a layer number, from zero), and output or target values
(unless -o is given).  Note that when no options are given, the inputs
and outputs, but no hidden unit values, are written.  If the -t option
is given, the outputs are replaced by "target" values generated from
the outputs, as defined by the data model.  The -t option is not
allowed for survival models, except for those with constant hazard.

The networks used to compute these values are taken from the named
log-file, with the specified range.  The range has the usual form,
"[low][:[high]][%mod]", with 'high' defaulting to 'low' if the colon
is absent, and to the end of the file if the colon is present.

In the first form, a file to read inputs from is specified, as
described in numin.doc (which is also used for data-spec).  Any data
transformations specified by data-spec are applied when these inputs
are read.

In the second form, each group of arguments beginning with "/"
describes a grid along one input dimension, with 'low' and 'high'
being the range of the grid along that dimension, and sz+1 being the
number of grid points spread across that range.  The number of such
argument groups must be the same as the number of input dimensions.
For survival models with non-constant hazard, the time input is
included amongst these inputs.  Any data transformations specified by
data-spec are NOT applied to these grid values.

The output consists of a section for each network, with sections
separated by blank lines.  Each section contains as many lines as
there are grid points or input values read, with each line giving the
input values followed by the values in the hidden layer or layers and
then the outputs or targets (omitting any of these that are not asked
for).  Any data transformations specified by data-spec are NOT applied
to the outputs or targets.
