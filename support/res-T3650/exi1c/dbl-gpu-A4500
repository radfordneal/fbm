Running exi1c with dbl-gpu on A4500:

Number of training cases: 4999
Precision: FP64, SIMD capability: AVX2 FMA, Use: SIMD FMA SLEEF
NVIDIA RTX A4500, Compute Capability 8.6, 56 SM processors, 18.5 GBytes ECC
Using 32 cases per block, 8 threads per case, max 75 blocks per launch
Shared mem per blk: 49152, shared mem per SM: 102400, blks per SM: 16
Desired blks per SM: 2, allowed shared mem per case: 1536 bytes, 192 values
Hid layer shrd mem: 0:80:0,80 T 168
With 4999 cases, need 3 launches, max 53 blocks/launch
With 1666 cases, need 1 launches, max 53 blocks/launch
