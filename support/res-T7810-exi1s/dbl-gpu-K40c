Running exi1s with dbl-gpu on K40c:

Number of training cases: 4999
Precision: FP64, SIMD capability: AVX2 FMA, Use: SIMD FMA SLEEF, Cfg: SQ2-Q2O2
Tesla K40c, Compute Capability 3.5, 15 SM processors, 11.2 GBytes ECC
Using 32 cases per block, max 500 blocks per launch, threads/case: 8
Shared mem/blk: 49152, Shared mem/SM: 49152, Blks/SM: 16
Desired # of blocks: 2, allowed shared mem per case: 768 bytes, 96 values
Hid layer shrd mem: 0:79:0,-1 T 88
With 4999 cases, need 1 launches, max 157 blocks/launch
