Running exb16 with dbl-gpu on K620:

Number of training cases: 300
Number of test cases: 1000
Precision: FP64, SIMD capability: AVX2 FMA, Use: SIMD FMA SLEEF
Quadro K620, Compute Capability 5.0, 3 SM processors, 2.0 GBytes
Using 32 cases per block, max 500 blocks per launch, threads/case: 8
Shared mem/blk: 49152, Shared mem/SM: 65536, Blks/SM: 32
Desired # of blocks: 2, allowed shared mem per case: 1024 bytes, 128 values
Hid layer shrd mem: 0:16:0,16 T 40
With 300 cases, need 1 launches, max 10 blocks/launch
