Running exi1b with dbl-gpu on GP100:

Number of training cases: 4999
Precision: FP64, SIMD capability: AVX2 FMA, Use: SIMD FMA SLEEF
Quadro GP100, Compute Capability 6.0, 56 SM processors, 15.9 GBytes ECC
Using 32 cases per block, 8 threads per case, max 75 blocks per launch
Shared mem per blk: 49152, shared mem per SM: 65536, blks per SM: 32
Desired blks per SM: 2, allowed shared mem per case: 1024 bytes, 128 values
Hid layer shrd mem: 0:80:0,-1 T 88
With 4999 cases, need 3 launches, max 53 blocks/launch
With 2499 cases, need 2 launches, max 40 blocks/launch
With 2500 cases, need 2 launches, max 40 blocks/launch
