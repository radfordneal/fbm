Running exi1b with flt-gpu on K620:

Number of training cases: 4999
Precision: FP32, SIMD capability: AVX2 FMA, Use: SIMD FMA SLEEF
Quadro K620, Compute Capability 5.0, 3 SM processors, 2.0 GBytes
Using 32 cases per block, max 75 blocks per launch, threads/case: 8
Shared mem/blk: 49152, Shared mem/SM: 65536, Blks/SM: 32
Desired # of blocks: 2, allowed shared mem per case: 1024 bytes, 256 values
Hid layer shrd mem: 0:80:0,80 T 168
With 4999 cases, need 3 launches, max 53 blocks/launch
With 2499 cases, need 2 launches, max 40 blocks/launch
With 2500 cases, need 2 launches, max 40 blocks/launch
