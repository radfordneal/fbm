Running exi2x with dbl-gpu on K40c:

Number of training cases: 3997
Precision: FP64, SIMD capability: AVX2 FMA, Use: SIMD FMA SLEEF
Tesla K40c, Compute Capability 3.5, 15 SM processors, 11.2 GBytes ECC
Using 32 cases per block, max 500 blocks per launch, threads/case: 8
Shared mem/blk: 49152, Shared mem/SM: 49152, Blks/SM: 16
Desired # of blocks: 2, allowed shared mem per case: 768 bytes, 96 values
Hid layer shrd mem: 0:272:-1,-1 T 0
With 3997 cases, need 1 launches, max 125 blocks/launch
