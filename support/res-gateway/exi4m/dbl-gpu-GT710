Number of training cases: 1500
Precision: FP64, SIMD capability: AVX, Use: SIMD SLEEF
NVIDIA GeForce GT 710, Compute Capability 3.5, 1 SM processors, 2.0 GBytes
Using 32 cases per block, max 500 blocks per launch, threads/case: 8
Shared mem/blk: 49152, Shared mem/SM: 49152, Blks/SM: 16
Desired # of blocks: 2, allowed shared mem per case: 768 bytes, 96 values
Hid layer shrd mem: 0:64:0,-1 1:16:64,-1 T 88
With 1500 cases, need 1 launches, max 47 blocks/launch
