Running exbgd with flt-gpu on P620:

Number of training cases: 800
Precision: FP32, SIMD capability: AVX2 FMA, Use: SIMD FMA SLEEF, Cfg: SQ2-Q2O2
Quadro P620, Compute Capability 6.1, 4 SM processors, 2.0 GBytes
Using 32 cases per block, max 500 blocks per launch, threads/case: 8
Shared mem/blk: 49152, Shared mem/SM: 98304, Blks/SM: 32
Desired # of blocks: 2, allowed shared mem per case: 1536 bytes, 384 values
Hid layer shrd mem: 0:15:0,15 T 40
With 800 cases, need 1 launches, max 25 blocks/launch
