Running exbgd with flt-gpu on M2000:

Number of training cases: 800
Precision: FP32, SIMD capability: AVX2 FMA, Use: SIMD FMA SLEEF
Quadro M2000, Compute Capability 5.2, 6 SM processors, 3.9 GBytes
Using 32 cases per block, max 500 blocks per launch, threads/case: 4
Shared mem/blk: 49152, Shared mem/SM: 98304, Blks/SM: 32
Desired # of blocks: 2, allowed shared mem per case: 1536 bytes, 384 values
Hid layer shrd mem: 0:15:0,15 T 36
With 800 cases, need 1 launches, max 25 blocks/launch

Number of iterations used: 1

Number of test cases: 500

Average log probability of targets:    -0.238+-0.025
