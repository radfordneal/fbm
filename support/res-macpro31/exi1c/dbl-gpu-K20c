Running exi1c with dbl-gpu on K20c:

Number of training cases: 4999
Precision: FP64, SIMD capability: SSE3, Use: SIMD SLEEF
Tesla K20c, Compute Capability 3.5, 13 SM processors, 4.6 GBytes ECC
Using 32 cases per block, 8 threads per case, max 75 blocks per launch
Shared mem per blk: 49152, shared mem per SM: 49152, blks per SM: 16
Desired blks per SM: 2, allowed shared mem per case: 768 bytes, 96 values
Hid layer shrd mem: 0:80:0,-1 T 88
With 4999 cases, need 3 launches, max 53 blocks/launch
With 1666 cases, need 1 launches, max 53 blocks/launch
With 1667 cases, need 1 launches, max 53 blocks/launch
