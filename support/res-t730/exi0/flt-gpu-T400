Number of training cases: 4999
Precision: FP32, SIMD capability: AVX, Use: SIMD FMA SLEEF
NVIDIA T400, Compute Capability 7.5, 6 SM processors, 1.8 GBytes
Using 32 cases per block, max 500 blocks per launch, threads/case: 8
Shared mem/blk: 49152, Shared mem/SM: 65536, Blks/SM: 16
Desired # of blocks: 2, allowed shared mem per case: 1024 bytes, 256 values
Hid layer shrd mem: 0:64:0,64 T 136
With 4999 cases, need 1 launches, max 157 blocks/launch
