/* RECORD DESCRIBING TRAINING AND TEST DATA.  This record is stored in the 
   log file, with type 'D' and index -1.  It gives the number of "input"
   and "target" values, the source of the training data in the form of 
   of 'numin' specifications, the transformations to be performed on the raw 
   inputs and targets, and whether the targets are required to be integers, 
   and if so their upper bound (the lower bound is zero). 

   The 'numin' specification for the training and test data should be used in 
   the context of the defauts mentioned in the documentation for 'data-spec.c'
   If not present, the test set specifications are empty strings. 

   This record is of variable length, varying with the number of
   inputs and targets, since the space needed for transformations
   varies.  The proper size if given by the data_spec_size macro.  The
   declared dimension of Max_inputs+Max_targets is the maximum, but 
   would waste space if actually used when not necessary. (But will
   be used if a data_specifications var is allocated statically.) */
