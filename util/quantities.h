/* This module establishes an interface though which an application-specific
   module can evaluate various quantities derived from the data stored in
   log files.  These values can then be used by various application-independent
   modules, such as one that plots traces of such quantities. 

   This header file must be included after log.h. 
*/


/* DESCRIPTION OF QUANTITIES WHOSE VALUES ARE WANTED. This array lists the
   quantities desired, identified by letter.  The 'available' flag is set
   if a quantity-evaluation module knows about the quantity so identified;
   the value +1 indicating that the module knows about the quantity and thinks
   it is meaningful, the value -1 indicating that the module knows about 
   the quantity but thinks it is not meaningful in the present context, and
   the value zero meaning that nobody has heard of this quantity.
   
   The 'modifier', 'low', and 'high' entries give the modifier for the
   quantity and the range of its values that are desired.  If the top-level 
   module sets the 'high' entry to -1, the actual value is filled in by the 
   application-specific module. */

/* STORAGE FOR VALUES OF QUANTITIES WANTED.  Contains pointers to sufficient
   storage to hold the values of all quantities that are described in some
   quantities_described structure.  The 'updated' fields record whether the
   data stored has been brought up to date.  A 'next' field is provided to 
   facilitate linking together structures for successive iterations.  Freeing 
   this structure will free both it and the arrays of doubles it points to
   (since they are allocated as a single block). */

   quantities, and for cleaning up.  Each array is terminated by a zero entry.
